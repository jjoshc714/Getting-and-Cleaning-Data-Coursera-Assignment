# Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins & Coursera

This assignment requires human smartphone data for human activity recognition https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
from UCI's Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Data:
The data consists of sensory recordings using the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II of 30 subjects doing various activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. 

### Goals:
1. Use the training and testing sets of the data to form a single clean dataset which is labeled appropriately and informatively for the "activity" column as well as the other variable names.

2. Create a tidy dataset which contains the average values for all variables for every subject and activity. This will be saved as a txt file: "tidydata.txt"

* The codes for 1. and 2. will be presented in an R file: "run_analysis.R"

3. Create a codebook which describes the data and variables while elaborating on the code done to clean the data.
